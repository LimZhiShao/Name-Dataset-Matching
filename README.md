# Name-Dataset-Matching
Hi, I am new to python, so the codes may not be that clean and nicelooking.

This is a program that matches names in a namelist with names in the target dataset and return the number of the name's occurence. 
The original intention of this program is to match attendancelist of all events held in the year with the master membership namelist.
The program returns 3 outputs: activememberlist, nonactivememberlist and nonmemberlist.
